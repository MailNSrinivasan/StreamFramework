# StreamFramework

Custom Stream Framework â€“ Open Source
     Streams are a powerful tool for transferring huge data with least memory foot print. Stream implemented applications yield better performance and are more scalable. On the flip side Streams are tricky to be used and requires more time and effort whilst the development stage. Therefore it is overlooked at the initial stage of coding and is mostly considered during performance bottle neck phases.
     Considering the difficulty in using Streams in development stage, I have created few Custom Wrapper classes which override the existing roadblocks in using them. It also provides certain common stream utility functions. This topic focus on the usage of these Utilities and not on the implementation details of the wrapper classes.  The source code in available for download !
